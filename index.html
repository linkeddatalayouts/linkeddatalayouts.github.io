A considerable amount of data on the Web is stored in native application formats.
Thus, such resources are not accessible for Linked Data applications.

While special purpose converters and meta data extractors from many native application formats to RDF exist, there is a lack of a more generic concept to perform these mappings.

With LiDL (Linked Data Layouts), we present such a generic concept, along with an RDF ontology, based on the constraint language SHACL to describe binary resource formats.

We present how binary resources can be lifted to a Linked Data representation by interpreting their structure according to its description given in a Linked Data Layout.
