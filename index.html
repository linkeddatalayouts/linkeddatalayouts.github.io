A considerable amount of data on the Web is stored in native application formats, e.g., [images](/examples/ppm), binary [TLV-encoded data](/examples/tlv), etc.

While there is a number of special purpose converters and meta data extractors for certain native application formats,
such native resources are in general not accessible for Linked Data applications.

With LiDL (Linked Data Layouts), we present a [generic concept](/specification), along with an [RDF vocabulary](/vocabularies), enabling 

- the semantic description of the structural layout of arbitrary native application formats, and
- the declarative mapping of user-defined content fragments of native application data to RDF.

Our [reference implementation](https://github.com/linkeddatalayouts/interpreter) allows for executing a mapping definition given a native application file and its layout specification.
